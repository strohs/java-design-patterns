# Iterator
* how traversal of data structures happens and who makes it happen
* an iterator is a class that facilitates the traversal
    * keeps a reference to the current element
    * knows how to move to a different element
* Java has Iterator<T> and Iterable<T>
    * Iterator<T> specifies the iterator API
    * Iterable<T> interface allows a class to be a target of the for-each-loop

## Implementation Steps

## Design Considerations


## Example

## Compare
Iterator | PATTERN
:---:|:---:   

## Pitfalls
* Iterators cannot be recursive (no co-routines support in Java)
